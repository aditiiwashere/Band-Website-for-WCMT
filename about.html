            <p> "We are exploring new territories with our music now, and in the seven years we've been a band together, we've sort of come to
                 learn a lot about each other. At the heart of it, we're four brown boys trying to spread our little personal stories to the 
                 world with our music. The LYTS EP talks about love and heartbreak."</p>
